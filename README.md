Test hashing algorithms in Scala.

This repository was made to test implementations of the 
[XXHash](www.xxhash.com) algorithms (XXH64 and XXH32) for [Cromwell
](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell).

There are currently two implementations of the xxhash algorithm in Java

* [lz4-java](https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java)
* [OpenHFT's zero allocation hashing](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Zero-Allocation-Hashing)

Both are tested in this repo.
